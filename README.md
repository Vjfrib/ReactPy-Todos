 # ReactPy Todos

This is a simple ToDo app, demonstrating the capabilities of the [ReactPy](https://reactpy.dev/) python framework.

The **ReactPy** framework allows you to design web apps in python using **react-like** syntax and features (such as `use_state`). 

As is the tradition when showcasing any new web-app framework, I have created a simple ToDo app.

## Features

* Toggle-able info card
* Add todos to list
    * Press `Enter` to submit
* Remove todo by clicking
* **Update todo** by holding `shift` while clicking
